# Ensemble_Techniques
Using ensemble techniques to develop enhanced ML-based models:

1) Forecasting the risk of diabetes (Diabetes_Risk_Prediction): <br>
A dataset of hundreds of female patients, provided by a biotech company, containing information about their age, skin thickness,
blood pressure, glucose, etc. has been utilized to identify those with high risk of diabetes. <br>
Key tools: Bootstrap Aggregating, Bagging Classifiers, Random Forests, cross-validation <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaporn, numpy, pandas

2) Wine quality prediction (Wine_Quality_Prediction): <br>
A dataset of red wines, provided by a wine producing company called Moonshine, which entails the chemical properties of different 
wines such as acidity, residual sugar, density, pH, percentage of alcoho, etc. has been used to separate premimum wines from the
others. <br>
Key tools: Bagging Classifiers, Random Forests, AdaBoost Classifiers, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaporn, numpy, pandas

2) Automation of visa approval process (EasyVisa): <br>
A variety of ML-based classification models have been leveraged to automate the process of screening work visas. Cross-validation and
hyperparameter tuni ghave been adopted to optimze the models and resolve their potential overfitting problem. Ultimately, the models
have been compared against each other, and the most accurate and skilled ones in identifying qualified workers whose visas should get
approved, have been selected. <br>
Key tools: Bagging Classifiers, Random Forests, Adaptive and Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Stacking Classifiers, hyperparameter tuning <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaporn, numpy, pandas
